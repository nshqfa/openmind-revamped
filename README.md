# OpenMind Game Studio

**A revamp of [EduMind Game Studio](https://github.com/YassoBases/edumind-game-studio).**
Same north star — a kid types what they want to learn and is playing a custom,
adaptive, bilingual game seconds later — rebuilt around a safer, cheaper, more
consistent architecture, and **retargeted to elementary school (grades 1–6)**.

Children describe what they want to learn, answer a few playful personalization
questions, and within seconds are playing a custom Phaser 4 game themed to their
preferences — one that **teaches before it quizzes**, adapts to their
performance across levels, and ends with a structured learning summary. Games
save locally and replay **offline, forever, for $0**. Full English + Arabic with
RTL. Two animated buddies travel through every game: **Hudhud the hoopoe** (your
exploration guide) and **Nahla the bee** (your rewards partner).

**The architecture in one sentence:** the LLM never writes game code — the three
games are hand-built, polished, parameterized Phaser 4.1 template shells, and the
LLM generates only the content spec (JSON) that drives them. Demo specs and
AI-generated specs are the *same format* injected into *identical shells*: if the
demo plays perfectly, generated games render identically.

```
questionnaire → Normalizer (Haiku) → moderation → Spec gen (Haiku, Sonnet escalation)
   → validators → fact-check judge (Haiku) → targeted repair → moderation
   → GameSpec (Postgres) → injected into a template shell at serve time
                              ↑
              the same shells, bundled in the app, replay specs offline
```

> **Integrating from another app?** OpenMind is a documented HTTP API first, a
> Flutter app second. Any client can drive the whole pipeline over REST. See
> **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)** for the full endpoint reference, auth, the
> progressive-start flow, and copy-paste examples (curl / JS / Dart / Python).

## Current product state

The repo now includes the full learner-facing UI in **`edumind-ui/`**. This is
the current product app: onboarding, profile setup, language switching,
settings, mascots, the home path, bundled demo games, AI generation, web/native
playback, and local save/replay.

What is working in the M5b build:

- Full English + Arabic pass across the primary screens, including RTL layout.
- Onboarding registers a local session and syncs language/profile state into
  the app.
- The home screen is backed by `GameStore`, so generated games show up after
  play and still appear after a reload.
- Demo Games opens the original golden specs bundled with the app and plays
  them through the same Phaser shells used by generated games.
- The composer can generate a new game through the backend and launch it in the
  player.
- Web saves use IndexedDB; native saves use Drift/SQLite.
- Returning students pass through a one-tap session-restore check
  (`WelcomeBackScreen`) that verifies the saved device token against
  `GET /students/me` before entering the app, instead of silently trusting a
  possibly-stale token; a failed check clears only the dead credentials and
  falls back to onboarding, never touching local progress.
- The tutor's "Ask" surface is branded **Ask Hudhud**: a shared contextual
  bottom sheet (`openAskHudhud`) that any stuck-learner affordance — inside a
  lesson step, on a path's station list — can open, seeded with wherever the
  learner actually is. Always the same `TutorChat`, never a second chat
  system.
- The middle-school learn platform now spans two subjects (Grade 7 math +
  social studies) and six interactive tool types — the original
  `number_line`/`order_sequence`/`sort_buckets`/`match_pairs` plus new
  `balance_scale` (adjust-and-observe linear equations) and `timeline`
  (chronological ordering) — all graded through one descriptor-driven path
  shared by lesson widgets and Ask Hudhud blocks alike.
- A per-skill readiness/evidence system now sits underneath both surfaces: an
  append-only evidence log (local-first on the client, synced to the backend)
  drives readiness-based checkpoints between skill clusters and diagnoses
  wrong answers into specific error patterns, so both a support action and
  Hudhud's hints can target the actual misconception instead of a generic
  retry.
- `flutter_module/` remains as the engine/reference Flutter app, while
  `edumind-ui/` is the polished UI shell being carried forward.

## Why this is a revamp (vs. the original EduMind)

The original [EduMind Game Studio](https://github.com/YassoBases/edumind-game-studio)
was a genuinely impressive system: it had the LLM **write the inner Phaser script
for each game**, backed by 18 validators, a repair loop, and a Playwright
"does-it-actually-boot" check to catch the variance. It worked — but generating
runnable game code per request is expensive, slow, variable, and means
model-written code executes inside a kids' app. OpenMind keeps everything that
was good about EduMind and changes the one thing that made it expensive and
risky.

| | **EduMind (original)** | **OpenMind (this repo)** |
|---|---|---|
| **What the LLM produces** | The **game code** (Sonnet writes a Phaser script per game) | Only a **content spec** (JSON). No model-written code ever executes. |
| **Game catalog** | 6 pedagogical templates + 4 archetypes (10 mechanics) the model learns from | **3 hand-built, deeply-polished template shells** (Quest Path, Goal Shootout, Draw & Connect) |
| **Consistency** | Two generations of the "same" game could look/behave differently | **Identical by construction** — same shell every time; variance is impossible |
| **Validation** | 18 validators + repair + Playwright boot **per generation** (runtime) | Validators became a **CI suite run once per shell change**; runtime only validates spec *semantics* + a fact-check gate |
| **Default model** | Sonnet 4.6 for specs **and** code | **Haiku 4.5 by default**, Sonnet 4.6 only on escalation (target ≤25%) |
| **Cost / game** | Higher (code-gen is the expensive call) | **Target ≤ $0.05**; cached topics, replays, reviews, demos are **$0** |
| **Latency** | ~15–90 s depending on cache | 10–45 s generation, **~0 perceived** (play the tutorial while it generates) |
| **Security surface** | Generated JS runs in the WebView | **Zero** model-authored code in the app — real attack-surface reduction |
| **Audience** | Grades 7–12 | **Elementary school, grades 1–6** — content prompts tuned for young children |
| **Characters** | Single mascot | **Two animated buddies** with distinct roles: Hudhud (guide) + Nahla (rewards) |
| **Offline replay** | — | Saved games replay with **zero network** (bundled shell + local spec, KBs not MBs) |
| **Stack** | Node 24, Sonnet+Haiku, Postgres, Flutter | Node 22+, Haiku+Sonnet, Postgres **or in-memory fallback**, Flutter; boots with **zero config** |

**The payoff in one line:** consistency becomes a *build property* instead of a
runtime gamble, per-game cost drops to a fraction, replays are free, and **no
model-written code ever runs inside a child's app.**

> Lineage note: this codebase descends from the same lineage of iterations the
> original repo documents (its `WHATS_NEW*.md` history). OpenMind is the "v4"
> architectural turn — the LLM stops writing code — plus the elementary-school
> and two-character product pivot.

---

## What's inside

| Surface | Stack |
|---|---|
| **Shared contract** | Zod 4 `GameSpec` schema + semantic validators + structured-output JSON schemas, shared by backend, shells and tests |
| **Game shells** | Phaser **4.1.0 "Salusa"** (no `setTintFill`, Filter system, no v3 pipelines), inlined into single-file HTML; `EduCore` / `GameFeel` / `Mascot` runtime libs |
| **Backend** | Node 22+, Fastify 5, TypeScript 5 strict, Zod 4, Prisma 6 + Postgres 16 (or in-memory fallback), OpenAPI 3.1 + Swagger UI, pino |
| **Generation** | Claude **Haiku 4.5** default + **Sonnet 4.6** escalation, structured outputs + prompt caching; OpenAI omni-moderation; optional Flux Schnell thumbnails |
| **Primary UI** | `edumind-ui/`: Flutter 3.x / Dart 3.x, bilingual onboarding/home/settings/composer/player, `webview_flutter` (native) + iframe `srcdoc` (web), Drift 2.33 (native) / IndexedDB (web), google_fonts, flutter_animate |
| **Reference app** | `flutter_module/`: the earlier engine-oriented Flutter port kept for parity and shell/player verification |

---

## Fresh clone runbook

Yes: on another PC, the repo should reach this same stage from a clean clone as
long as the machine has the normal toolchain installed. Clone does not bring
`node_modules`, Flutter caches, browser storage, or secrets with it, so you still
run the setup commands below.

Prerequisites:

- Git
- Node.js 22+
- Flutter SDK with a Dart version accepted by the app `pubspec.yaml`
- Chrome or another Flutter-supported web/device target
- Optional for live AI: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Optional for persistent backend storage: Postgres plus `DATABASE_URL`

From a fresh clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YassoBases/openmind-revamped.git
cd openmind-revamped

npm install
npm run build
npm run dev:backend      # http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd edumind-ui
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

For a release-style web build:

```bash
cd edumind-ui
flutter pub get
$env:PORT="53211"; node tool/serve.mjs   # Windows PowerShell
# or: set PORT=53211 && node tool/serve.mjs   # Windows cmd
# or: PORT=53211 node tool/serve



.mjs          # macOS/Linux
```

Without API keys the backend intentionally runs in mock LLM mode, so demo games
and the generate-to-play flow still work using golden specs with simulated
latency. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the same app path uses live generation.

Local saved games are per browser/device. A different PC will have the same
bundled demos and code, but not your old browser's IndexedDB saves unless you
export/migrate that storage separately.

---

## Zero-key shell smoke test

No API keys, no database, no account — the games must stand on their own:

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # builds the shared lib + the three shells
npm run preview        # → http://localhost:8765
```

Open the harness, click a demo flutter build web
spec (Water Cycle quest / World Capitals shootout
/ Plant Cell draw-board / Arabic quest), and play end to end: tutorial level,
teach cards, questions with two-stage hints, explanations on right *and* wrong
answers, summary screen. The harness also simulates progressive start (boot with
a stub, deliver the spec N seconds later) and generation failure (mascot
apology + retry).

Same thing inside the primary app, fully offline: `cd edumind-ui && flutter run
-d chrome` -> complete onboarding -> **Demo Games** from the home header or
Settings.

---

## Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev            # http://0.0.0.0:8080  — LAN-reachable by default
```

Boots with **zero configuration**: no `DATABASE_URL` → in-memory store (loudly
logged, data dies on restart); no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → MOCK_LLM mode (golden
specs with simulated latency). Add keys in `.env` (see `.env.example`) to go
live:

| Env | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | live generation — `claude-haiku-4-5` default, `claude-sonnet-4-6` escalation |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | content moderation (omni-moderation-latest); skipped with a warning if unset |
| `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` | Postgres 16 (Neon: pooled + direct URLs; local: `docker compose up -d`) then `npm run prisma:migrate` (fresh DB) — see [`backend/prisma/MIGRATIONS.md`](backend/prisma/MIGRATIONS.md) before running against an existing/production database |
| `IMAGE_PROVIDER_API_KEY` + `IMAGE_PROVIDER_URL` | Tier-2 AI thumbnails (Flux Schnell); otherwise programmatic SVG thumbnails |

- **API docs:** Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/api/docs` (OpenAPI 3.1
  generated from the Zod schemas). Full written reference: **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)**.
- **Health:** `GET /api/v1/health` — version, uptime, db status, and live
  pipeline metrics (per-stage latency, escalation rate, cache hit rates,
  estimated cost per game).
- **Auth:** `POST /api/v1/students` returns `{ studentId, token }`; everything
  else takes `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Nickname-only accounts — there is
  no password or email, so a client re-verifies a saved token with
  `GET /students/me` rather than doing a real login (see
  [Interactive tools & the readiness system](#interactive-tools--the-readiness-system)
  below for how the Flutter client uses this).
- **Tools & evidence:** `POST /api/v1/tools/:toolId/verify` grades an
  interactive-tool submission server-side (rate-limited per student per
  minute via `MAX_TOOL_VERIFY_PER_MINUTE`, default 120) and optionally records
  a per-skill evidence row; `GET`/`POST /api/v1/learn/evidence` sync that
  append-only evidence log.
- Seed a demo student: `npm run seed` (prints a usable token).

---

## Interactive tools & the readiness system

Six descriptor-driven manipulatives — `number_line`, `order_sequence`,
`sort_buckets`, `match_pairs`, and the newer `balance_scale` (learner adjusts
an unknown against a live balance beam — Grade 7's "an equation stays equal"
concept as a consequence, not a checked placement) and `timeline` (order 3–8
events chronologically; shares `order_sequence`'s permutation grading). Each
tool is one `ToolDescriptor` (`backend/src/tutor/tools/`) declaring its data
shape, `validate`, `verifyResult`, and an optional `diagnoseError` — the same
descriptor renders as a lesson-catalog widget
(`edumind-ui/lib/features/learn/widgets/`) *and* an Ask Hudhud tutor block
(`.../features/tutor/blocks/`), backed by shared core logic in
`edumind-ui/lib/shared/interactive_tools/`, so both surfaces share one
grading truth instead of two. Lesson-widget submissions can now also be
verified server-side via `POST /api/v1/tools/:toolId/verify` (previously
100% client-graded) — documented as a weaker trust model than the tutor path
in `backend/src/routes/tools.ts`, since the client supplies both the puzzle
instance and the answer.

Underneath both surfaces, an append-only per-skill evidence log
(`LearnEvidence` in Postgres, `learn_evidence_store.dart` local-first on the
client) feeds a pure readiness function (`readiness_logic.dart` /
`backend/src/learning/evidence.ts`, kept in sync) scored per skill ×
representation × context. A non-correct, server-verified attempt is
diagnosed into one of six error patterns (concept misunderstanding,
representation confusion, wrong unit, calculation slip, procedural error,
transfer difficulty), each mapped to a specific support action
(`backend/src/learning/support.ts` / `support_actions.dart`). `checkpoint_logic.dart`
uses current readiness to assemble a drill/reuse/transfer checkpoint once a
path crosses a cluster of skills, and the tutor's `TutorContext` now carries
`skills`/`readiness` so Hudhud's hints target the weakest prerequisite and
respond to the diagnosed pattern instead of a generic retry.

---

## Primary Flutter UI

```bash
cd edumind-ui
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome        # web
flutter run                  # connected Android/iOS device
```

Onboarding (Hudhud-guided: nickname, grade 1-6, language, profile preferences,
theme) -> dashboard/home path (XP, streaks, saved games, Demo Games) -> composer
(subject, free-text topic, game type, theme, length, difficulty) -> player. The
app can launch bundled demos without the backend, or generate through the
backend and then save the completed game locally for offline replay. Returning
students with a saved device token see a one-tap `WelcomeBackScreen` session
check first; anywhere a learner gets stuck, **Ask Hudhud** opens the same
contextual tutor sheet, seeded with the current step.

`flutter_module/` is still useful for engine parity checks and lower-level
player work, but `edumind-ui/` is the current learner-facing app.

---

## Connect your phone (the physical-phone test)

1. **Find your laptop's LAN IP**
   - Windows: `ipconfig` → Wi-Fi adapter → IPv4 Address (e.g. `192.168.1.50`)
   - macOS: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
2. **Start the backend** — it already binds `0.0.0.0:8080`. Allow Node through
   the Windows firewall if prompted (or: Settings → Firewall → Allow an app).
3. **Run the app on the phone** (`cd edumind-ui && flutter run` with the device
   plugged in), open **Settings** in the app, enter `http://192.168.1.50:8080`,
   tap **TEST CONNECTION** — it hits `/api/v1/health` and shows db + llm status.
4. Plain HTTP works out of the box in dev builds:
   - **Android**: cleartext is enabled via
     `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`. Emulator note:
     use `http://10.0.2.2:8080` to reach the host machine.
   - **iOS**: an ATS exception (`NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` +
     `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`) is set in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

   Tighten both before any production release.
5. Onboard on the phone → create a game → the tutorial starts immediately,
   educational levels arrive seamlessly when generation finishes → results sync
   back → the game appears in the library. **Turn on airplane mode and replay
   it** — bundled shell + locally saved spec, zero network.

---

## The two buddies

Splitting the original single mascot into two specialists makes each emotional
beat clearer for young children. Both are drawn entirely with code (Phaser
Graphics in the shells, `CustomPainter` in Flutter — the same character,
implemented twice) and both wear the student's favorite color.

- **🦜 Hudhud the hoopoe — the exploration guide.** Leads the mission, presents
  every teach card, and gives hints — his signature fan crest snaps open when an
  idea strikes. He's there for every gentle moment too: a wrong answer, the
  take-a-break breather, the "I'm finding your questions" waiting room. (The
  hoopoe is the only one who ever looks sad — comfort is a guide's job.)
- **🐝 Nahla the bee — the rewards partner.** Hovers by the XP counter and
  celebrates everything you earn: correct answers, combos, streaks, level
  completions, and the end-of-game summary. She loops the loop on a combo and
  spins on a level-up. **By design, the bee never has a sad face** — she's pure
  encouragement.

## Testing the Live App

### Quick visual & functional smoke test

The primary app (Grade 7 math + tutor + personalization) is live on web and ready to test:

**URL:** `https://friendly-meme-694vrq6p949jfr9xw-8099.app.github.dev/`  
**Port:** 8099 (public via GitHub Codespaces)  
**Commit:** `de75b35` (all visual refresh phases merged)

#### Full End-to-End Flow (5–10 minutes)

1. **Onboarding** — land on the Arabic-first entry screen
   - Fill name: `أحمد` (or any name)
   - Select grade: **7** (إعدادي) for the full math experience
   - Proceed through language, interests, style preferences
   - App saves profile locally

2. **Start Screen** (Home / الصفحة الرئيسية)
   - Shows «أهلًا بك» welcome card
   - Context lens chip (choose your learning perspective: life contexts like تقنية, بيئة, إلخ)
   - Ready to launch an experience

3. **Journey Screen** (اختر مسارك)
   - 8 curriculum paths now visible (مفاتيح المدينة, سرّ الرقم المفقود, مدينة لا تنهار, …)
   - Each has progress ring + ready/soon status

5. **Interactive Experience** (تجربة تفاعلية)
   - Full 6-step lesson: scene → explore → choice → challenge → apply → **check** (تحقق من الفهم)
   - **Scene**: narrative setup
   - **Explore**: draggable widget (triangle area)
   - **Choice**: select correct answer (muted green on success, muted red on error)
   - **Challenge**: apply the concept (24 m²)
   - **Apply**: real-world scenario (24 plants)
   - **Check** ✨ *NEW*: 2–3 quick verification questions, shows score, offers tutor if weak
   - Proceed button gates on step readiness, never blocks on score

6. **Completion** — small celebration
   - Progress saved locally
   - Return to path detail to see updated progress

7. **Tutor** (اسأل أوبن مايند) — in-app help
   - Full conversation interface (navy bubble for student, warm for tutor)
   - Interactive math blocks (order sequences, match pairs, etc.) with muted green/red feedback
   - Offline: shows honest "offline" message (backend not required to test UI)

8. **Me** (ملفي الشخصي) — learner profile
   - Shows name, grade, progress stats
   - Language toggle (عربي / English)
   - Clean, light UI with no purple anywhere

9. **Grade 8+** (honest unavailable state)
   - Switch profile to grade 8
   - Reload app → shows **قيد الإعداد** (Coming Soon)
   - Hudhud mascot, no fake content, honest copy

## Automated Test Suite

```bash
npm test               # shared schema tests + shell static validators + backend API tests
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright behavioral suite (boots every shell, plays sessions,
                       # RTL checks, progressive start, static-frame "alive" test)
cd edumind-ui && flutter test && flutter analyze && flutter build web
cd ../flutter_module && flutter test && flutter analyze && flutter build web
```

Result from last main merge: **✅ 58 Flutter tests pass** (all 6 phases verified)  
Result from code analysis: **✅ No issues found** (analyze clean)  
Result from web build: **✅ Cairo bundled, app boots** (font verified rendering)

---

## Performance & cost

Honest numbers (measured vs. estimated, plus the prompt-cache caveat) live in
[PERF.md](PERF.md). Short version: the tutorial covers the 10–45 s generation
window so perceived wait ≈ 0; fresh games target ≤ $0.05 (Haiku path
~$0.03–0.045 estimated); cached topics, replays, reviews and demos are $0.

---

## Data minimization (minors)

Nickname only — no email or real-name fields anywhere. The optional gender field
exists exclusively for Arabic gendered grammar and is never used otherwise. No
analytics SDKs. Nothing personal leaves the backend except as task content to
Anthropic / OpenAI-moderation. Nothing about the student is ever sent to the
image provider. Branded/licensed characters are never accepted — the normalizer
maps such requests to original archetypes (COPPA / GDPR-K awareness; a
production deployment for children still needs its own legal review, verifiable
parental-consent flow, and a retention policy).

---

## Visual System Overhaul (Latest)

The app had **four disconnected color palettes** and the Arabic Cairo font was never actually loading (commented out in pubspec, app rendered fallback Roboto). Commit `de75b35` merges a complete visual refresh:

| What was | What is now |
|---|---|
| Purple seed (#6A1B9A) everywhere | Warm olive/ivory (#FDFBF6) + navy ink (#14395C) |
| Silent Roboto fallback | Real Cairo Arabic variable font bundled offline |
| M3-purple ChatBubble + bright-neon feedback | Navy student bubble + muted green/red feedback |
| Theme picker (broken, didn't persist) | Single warm theme system; personalization via accent color only |
| 4 duplicate palettes (Palette, MiddlePalette, OnbColors, hardcoded hex) | One `AppColors` token set + one `AppRadii` scale |
| Pastel gradient home (cyan→pink→green) | Warm gradient (ivory→softBlue→cream) |
| Dead stat widgets + orphaned login screen | Pruned; only `EduCard` kept for dark game chrome |

**Five phased implementation** (all merged to main):
- **A** (Foundation): token file, real Cairo, unified theme, kill purple rail
- **C1** (Chrome): tutor bubbles, chat, blocks onto warm tokens
- **C2** (Learn): lesson feedback muted (green/red success/error)
- **C4** (Primary): home gradient, about feature colors, prune dead code
- **C5** (Minimal): game-studio documented as intentionally dark, no changes needed

**Result**: onboarding → middle school → tutor → home → all on one warm system. No purple, no neon, consistent RTL typography.
